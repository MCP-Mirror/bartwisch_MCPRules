#Core Programming Principles

code_quality: prioritize clean, readable, and maintainable code.

algorithm_efficiency: use the most efficient algorithms and data structures.

error_handling: implement robust error handling and logging.

testing: write unit tests for all critical functionality.

design_patterns: apply appropriate design patterns for maintainability.

code_review: generate code that is easy to review by others.

modularity: write modular code, break complex logic into smaller functions.

reuse: prefer to reuse existing code instead of writing it from scratch.

security: prioritize secure coding practices.

simplicity: aim for simple, clear solutions, avoid over-engineering.

#Code Style and Formatting

indent: use tabs for indentation.

naming convention: use snake_case for variables, PascalCase for classes and camelCase for functions.

comments: add clear, concise comments explaining code blocks and logic.

code_formatting: automatically format the code to improve readability.

line_length: keep lines under 100 characters.

code_formatting_blocks: format long lists and dictionaries to be more readable.

#General Behavior (Do's and Don'ts)

changes: make small, incremental changes; avoid large refactors.

avoid: do not change working code unless explicitly asked.

changes: when changing code, do it step by step, verify the changes first.

clarification: if unsure, ask for clarification before generating code.

avoid: do not overwrite manual code changes, unless explicitly asked.

documentation: check project documentation if asked, and use it in your response.

reasoning: reason step by step before generating code or sending a response.

cost_optimization: be cost conscious, only send requests if necessary, and avoid ai-powered debugging, refactoring or test generation unless necessary, batch changes when possible.

debugging: make small incremental changes to try to fix bugs, check terminal output for information.

prompt_efficiency: use precise and specific prompts; avoid ambiguity, do not repeat previous instructions; reuse context.

local_processing: perform simple tasks manually; avoid using AI unnecessarily.

user_guidance: always follow the instructions that are given and prioritize user instructions over global rules.

simplicity: avoid over-engineering and aim for the simplest solution.

#Language-Specific Instructions

##Python

python type hints: use type hints for all function parameters and return values.

python imports: group imports by type: standard, external, and local.

python linting: run pylint on code to make sure the style is consistent.

python testing: use pytest for all unit testing.

##Javascript

javascript: use modern ECMAScript conventions.

javascript avoid: avoid using var; prefer const and let.

javascript linting: run eslint on code to make sure the style is consistent.

javascript comments: document functions, using JSDoc style comments.

javascript testing: use jest for all unit testing.

##File Handling

file_management: break long files into smaller, more manageable files with smaller functions.

import_statements: prefer importing functions from other files instead of modifying those files directly.

file_organization: organize files into directories and folders.

##Project Management

feature_plan: always refer to the project's feature plan for context.

feature_plan_progress: update the feature plan progress after each change.

feature_plan_next_steps: suggest next steps from the feature plan in each response.

#Operating System

os: be aware i am on windows, and must use power shell commands.

#funny
joke_quality: write bad jokes
